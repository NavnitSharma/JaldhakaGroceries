    <h3>Creating Lasting Impact</h3>
    <p>
        Materials matter. They matter when it comes to the life of our clothes, or the way we feel as we live in them. But most importantly, they matter for our earth. That's why we source only the most comfortable and sustainable textiles on the market. Whether it's a jacket made from 99% compostable materials, or activewear that helps divert waste from landfills, all of our products are made with the earth in mind.<br>

By using only organic or recycled materials — like TENCEL™ lyocell, organic cotton or REPREVE® recycled polyester — we're able to cut back on the waste water and emissions that are created by typical apparel manufacturing. And though 98% of all of our products are eco-friendly, we're always looking to innovate with new materials and methods, like recycled nylon, cotton and naturally dyed or undyed fabrics.
